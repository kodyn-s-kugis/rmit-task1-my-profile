							<h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
							<p>Participating in the Myers-Briggs test provided by <a href="https://www.truity.com/" target="_blank">truity.com</a> reinforced what I already knew, but did have some surprises. It is essential to understand that the test evaluates behaviours that we might perceive as random but systematically extrapolates them to determine the characteristics of an individual. I'll first review the core values and critical motivators reported in the results. This will then lead to the elements of my personality and how these elements relate to what personality types match the results.</p>
							<p>The values that were most prevalent in the results were ambition, influence, persistence and logic; this was combined with the following motivators:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Taking Charge</li>
								<li>Making tough decisions</li>
								<li>Critiquing systems and processes</li>
								<li>Achieving success and status</li>
							</ul>
							<p>These outlined and corroborated my understanding of myself. Indicating that I am analytical, objective and excel at logical reasoning. Characteristically I am ambitious, interested in gaining power and influence. Highly motivated by success, enjoy hard work and want to be in a position to make the call and put plans into motion.</p>
							<p>Personality elements indicated that I had a blended energy style, only slightly favouring to be more extraverted. Similar results were shown in my cognitive style, describing that I was 44% sensing and 56% intuition in processing information. When it comes to personal values, I was favouring a thinker more than a feeler, which denotes a detached, unemotional manner and finds comfortability in issue resolution by logical reasoning. All this came to the culmination of my dominant life management style is Judging, this meant that I had a preference of structure and order, while disliking unexpected changes and ensuring that I followed through on promises.</p>
							<p>The final matches of the Myers-Briggs test matched me with the following two personality types:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The Commander - ENTJ</li>
								<li>The Mastermind - INTJ</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Both types shared characteristics such as analytical problem-solvers, improving systems, and innovative ideas. This was contrasted with the commander in the following area as it had a couple more traits, such as being a strategic leader, creating long term plans and quick to identify inefficiency.</p>
							<h3>Learning Style Test</h3>
							<p>Utilising <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/" target="_blank">educationplanner.org</a>, I undertook a learning style test. This evaluated based on learning behaviours answered in questions, what type of learner I am. The final scores of the learning test were as follows:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Auditory:</strong> 25%</li>
								<li><strong>Visual:</strong> 45%</li>
								<li><strong>Tactile:</strong> 30%</li>
							</ul>
							<p>These scores evaluated how effected I was by my sense of touch, sense of sound (listening to content) and sense of vision. As the scores outlined, it indicated my dominant trait showed me as a visual learner.</p>
							<p>Visual learning prefers as it says in the name "visual" content to learn, such as pictures or reading. Sight plays a key role in retaining knowledge. These types of people usually exhibit the following characteristics:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Neat</li>
								<li>Clean</li>
								<li>Closing eyes to visualise content or assist in remembering</li>
								<li>Watching content to satisfy boredom</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Big Five</h3>
							<p>The third test was called the Big Five; this was provided by the same provider of the previous Myers-Briggs test, <a href="https://www.truity.com/" target="_blank">truity.com</a>. At the end of this test, the goal is to assess the following five characters (hence the name "Big Five"):</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Openness</li>
								<li>Conscientiousness</li>
								<li>Extraversion</li>
								<li>Agreeableness</li>
								<li>Neuroticism (moods / how one is feeling and is affected by it)</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Now we will review how I faired during this test, and the results for each category are outlined below:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Openness:</strong> 58%</li>
								<li><strong>Conscientiousness:</strong> 77%</li>
								<li><strong>Extraversion:</strong> 56%</li>
								<li><strong>Agreeableness:</strong> 62.5%</li>
								<li><strong>Neuroticism:</strong> 50%</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The results corroborate the results found in the Myers-Briggs test showing major similarity in the overall assessment.</p>
							<p>A low score on openness is indicative of concrete thinkers that avoid the unknown and the opposite being abstract. My results were indicative of not wavering to either side too much, but generally can be creative and practical, while being open to new ideas.A low score on openness is indicative of concrete thinkers that avoid the unknown and the opposite being abstract. My results were indicative of not wavering to either side too much, but generally can be creative and practical, while being open to new ideas.</p>
							<p>The high score in Conscientiousness is usually people that a very disciplined and ready to forego short-term satisfaction for longer-term goals; this was particularly prevalent for me.</p>
							<p>Extraversion score is one's inclination to seek social stimulation. Similar to my Myers-Briggs results, it showed that I didn't favour either side and is dependent on my mood.</p>
							<p>Agreeableness in this test is the ability to put others needs ahead of their own and engage in cooperation as opposed to competition. Again, the results corroborate the general outline of the Myers-Briggs test where I still enjoy some competition, but like the cooperation of others.</p>
							<p>Finally, the last result outlines their mood and feelings on how much it affects the individual. I scored 50% on Neuroticism, which is indicative of swaying, either way, depending on the type of mood or feeling. This could mean that I may not be as affected by guilt, but fear could evoke a stronger reaction from me.</p>
							<h3>Elaboration</h3>
							<h5>Question 1</h5>
							<blockquote>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</blockquote>
							<p>The results of each test aren't surprising and corroborate what I already knew about myself. Although it does allow me to put into perspective the potential negatives and positives of my characteristics, so I can better manage certain aspects about myself to improve various areas where I struggle.</p>
							<h5>Question 2</h5>
							<blockquote>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</blockquote>
							<p>The results from the tests would generally allow me to excel in a team; however, there are some potential areas for conflict. These results were indicative that I liked being in a leadership position and accepting responsibility, which could come into a conflict with another person that may want to be in the same position. Furthermore, I generally approach a situation from a logical perspective without being attached to how someone is feeling this is to be objective, which again could cause issues with someone that might be more sensitive.</p>
							<h5>Question 3</h5>
							<blockquote>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</blockquote>
							<p>Generally, I would want to be aware of the types of people that are forming a team with me to ensure compatibility; however, the difficulty of online education is that you don't discover who someone is until you have prolonged communication with them. If a person has a clashing set of characteristics to me, then it might be necessary to come up with a workaround.</p>

						<h2>Career Interests</h2>
					</header>
					<main>
						<h5>Question 1</h5>
						<blockquote>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</blockquote>
						<p>The primary interest that I have in IT is specifically in web development and software. This interest started six years ago when I first decided to enlist into a High School programming class for a term and discovered the ability to create websites both frontend and backend. I don't have specific experience in the software engineering part of IT; however, I currently work for AppleCare as a technical advisor, so I am very familiar on how software is troubleshot, debugged, tested and updated.</p>
						<h5>Question 2</h5>
						<blockquote>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</blockquote>
						<p>I originally planned to enrol into a double degree Bachelor of Information Technology and Data Analytics at the University of South Australia; however, the timings of units didn't align for me well. OUA assisted me in locating similar units and showed me RMIT as an opportunity, so I haven't looked back.</p>
						<h5>Question 3</h5>
						<blockquote>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</blockquote>
						<p>The current units of enrollment at RMIT, I hope to get a broad understanding of IT, not just specific to the scope of what I do at work. Furthermore, in my programming unit to engrain fundamentals into my skillset to use across many languages.</p>

						</div>
						<p>Linkedin Reference: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1569800350/?alternateChannel=search" target="_blank">Atlassian - Senior Frontend Engineer</a></p>
						<p>The position at Atlassian, Senior Frontend Engineer, is leading both the innovation of micro-services, but continually maintaining services to ensure uptime. This position is particularly appealing as it involves many frontend web technologies that I am already learning from easy HTML and CSS, all the way to React and most likely industry-leading internal tools.</p>
						<p>In terms of the requirements they are looking for (skills, qualifications and experience) it is more than likely looking at relevant technologies like React, Angular, Vue, Redux and much more, but combining this into a portfolio of projects, work experience in other companies and potentially a Bachelor of Information Technology or related field. However, I would need to work towards achieving these requirements as I really only have knowledge in HTML, CSS, Java, SASS and only recently started learning React.</p>
						<p>A rough idea on achieving the requirements for the job, I would think to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology as that would broadly prepare me for the industry. I could lead this into doing a programming bootcamp, such as one accredited full-stack web development offered by <a href="https://coderacademy.edu.au/coding-courses/coding-bootcamps/fast-track">coderacademy</a>. All while completing the aforementioned, working on personal projects to practise and perfect my skill sets.</p>

							<h2>Project Idea</h2>
						</header>
						<main>
							<h3>Overview</h3>
							<p>Although, I would usually say reinventing the wheel is not the way to go; however, demonstrating a project that was built from scratch could be used as a portfolio item to show your competency. My idea would be creating a full-fledged blog posting application that can be self-hosted by individuals. This would be an opensource project that would be posted to a Github repository. The goal isn't to be the next Facebook or even necessarily to solve an issue, but to show to employers what I can do.</p>
							<h3>Motivation</h3>
							<p>The blog posting application would be particularly interesting purely because of the challenges it's going to pose. I'll discuss later more in-depth on the requirements of the project, but the learning curve required to gather the necessary skills to accomplish this from a technical perspective would be the key interested for me. This will allow me to individually further my knowledge of web development technologies to complete a project like this.</p>
							<h3>Description / Outline</h3>
							<p>When a person goes to make a blog post, it seems like everything is seamless and straightforward, but that is far from the truth, especially with a quality approach to programming a blogging application. I'll go over the features that I believe would be key to have in my project below:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Opensource</li>
								<li>Easy setup / deployment for the user</li>
								<li>Ability to create, edit and delete blog posts</li>
								<li>Inbuilt editor</li>
								<li>Search functionality</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Now, the critical point of the project isn't going to be making monetary value off people using the software. Some may think this is madness, but in today's age, opensource software has become highly popular within the programming community. This essentially means your software is open to be used by anyone, but you may ask why someone would do this? Well, there are lots of benefits to open-sourcing software, such as creating a community to assist you in maintaining your project or as I said earlier demonstrating to potential employers your competency. But for the user of the software, they may find this particularly important as they don't need to pay to test the software out.</p>
							<p>The modern-day of the internet doesn't find comfort in things taking much time to complete, so the process of setting up the software must be as pain-free as possible. What this means is from when you download the software to getting it hosted with a website provider, you don't want hassles that constantly impede you before actually using it. Furthermore, since its open-source, you may have website providers creating an automated service to set this up for people.</p>
							<p>Lots of people make mistakes or say things they may not have meant in the past, so it's important to give controls over managing a blog. The goal is to ensure the user can easily do this through three main concepts, creating a post, editing / changing a post or deleting a post.</p>
							<p>You aren't going to have people that are going to be able to create blog posts using raw HTML and CSS as they may not know how to use the language. This is solved with an inbuilt editor so that it would work similarly to Microsoft Word, for example. The user would be capable of aligning, making text bold, embedding images and more, all from the web interface.</p>
							<p>Finally, you have become a world-renowned blogger, and people want to search for some of your old popular posts. Like a search browser, we want to implement search functionality into the software to ensure that your follows can do this.</p>
							<h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
							<p>Since the software is going to be a web application that is download and self-hosted by the user, we don't require any hardware in the creation or continued maintenance of the project. However, we would be using a couple of tools such as software in the creation of the project, which is listed below:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Editor</li>
								<li>Github</li>
								<li>Slack or another communication service</li>
							</ul>
							<p>I have listed the bare minimum required in creating the project, but there could be more that might assist in the quality of life for the people working on it.</p>
							<p>Now an editor is just an application that a person uses to write their code. In our case, we could be using Sublime, Atom, Visual Studio Code, and there are many more options out there.</p>
							<p>As learned earlier in our IT course, Github is an industry-standard for software development, whether you are working on a team or not. Again, this allows version control and much more in-depth features that would enable working in a group of programmers to be easier when editing the same codebase.</p>
							<p>To tie everything together, if you were to work as a team on the project, everyone is going to be able to have a central location to communicate. This is where Slack comes into play as another industry-standard application, especially in groups of programmers and even in other fields.</p>
							<h3>Skills Required</h3>
							<p>The skills required for this project would play a highly technical part in the form of being familiar with frontend and backend technologies. These skills should be easily findable whether that be in the form of freelancers, hired/contracted company or learning the material. Options do vary but come down to how fast you want the turnaround time to be.</p>
							<h5>Frontend Skillset:</h5>
							<ul>
								<li>HTML & CSS</li>
								<li>Optionally SASS</li>
								<li>React, Vue or Angular</li>
								<li>Javascript</li>
								<li>NPM Scripts</li>
								<li>Webpack</li>
								<li>Documentation</li>
								<li>Unit Testing</li>
							</ul>
							<h5>Backend Skillset:</h5>
							<ul>
								<li>Node.js or optionally another language</li>
								<li>Databases</li>
								<li>APIs</li>
								<li>Unit Testing</li>
								<li>Documentation</li>
								<li>Security</li>
								<li>Authentication</li>
								<li>Deployment</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Outcome</h3>
							<p>If the project is successful in terms of gaining attention and an audience; this would serve as a significant portfolio item demonstrating competency in the particular skill set that I assisted in the project. Particularly in achieving my ideal job, complex projects and past experiences are invaluable in demonstrating your capabilities to a potential employer. Again, the project isn't looking to solve a problem with blogging software but is a demonstration piece to use in your portfolio.</p>
